# Working locally

Typically (and in production), the conversation logic you write will be executed in a hosted environment ([AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)). However, during development, you may execute your logic invocations on your local machine.

By using the [Dev Server](doc:dev-server) in "Local Testing" mode, your code will execute on your local machine instead of our hosted environment.

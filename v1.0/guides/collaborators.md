title: "Collaborators"
excerpt: ""
---
You can add collaborators to your Init projects so you can work on projects together. It's currently an experimental feature so there are a few limitations to it's functionality.

1. We only support collaborating with users that have an Init account
2. Only the owner of a project can add and remove Collaborators
3. Adding a Collaborator to your Init project **does not** give them access to the associated GitHub repo. You will need to do that manually!

## Adding Collaborators

First, navigate to the project you wish to add a Collaborator to. Then add `/collaborators` to the URL to get to the Collaborators view.

The URL should look something like this `https://console.init.ai/#/project/<PROJECT_ID>/collaborators`.

Next, add your Collaborators GitHub username into the text input and hit `Add`.

> **Important:** Collaborators must already be Init users!

To remove a Collaborator, click the `Remove` button near their email.

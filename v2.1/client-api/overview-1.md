The public version of the Init.ai API is referred to as the **Remote API** and allows external systems to manage users and conversations related to these users on behalf of an Init.ai application. This API follows traditional [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) principles. Data is sent and received as JSON and is served over HTTPS.

The current version of the API lives at **https://api.init.ai/v1** . All endpoints are served relative to this base URL.
